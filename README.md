# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Immune System: Database Resilience PoC

**Project Title:** `Cyber Immune System 1.0v - Created by waruna.dilshan`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Disclaimer

**This project is created strictly for educational and research purposes only.**

The "Hacker Window" and simulated attack features are designed solely to demonstrate **Database Failover** and **System Resilience** concepts in a controlled environment. The source code **must not** be used for any illegal, unethical, or malicious activities. The developer and contributors hold no responsibility for any misuse of this code.

**Intended Audience:** Software Engineering Students, Cybersecurity Researchers, and Developers learning about High Availability systems.

### üìù Project Overview

This is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) application built in Java Swing to demonstrate **database resilience** and a **self-healing failover mechanism** against simulated database failures (simulating a cyber attack).

The core of this system is the intelligent `DBHandler` which ensures application continuity by seamlessly switching from a primary database (`user_db`) to a redundant backup database (`user_backup_db`) when the primary one fails. This showcases a critical principle in **High Availability (HA)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)**, essential for robust cyber defense architecture.

### üí° Core Security & Engineering Concept

* **Cyber Resilience:** The application maintains operational service (read/write functionality) even when the primary data source is compromised or offline, effectively preventing a **Denial of Service (DoS)** to the user data layer.
* **Failover Logic:** The `DBHandler` attempts to connect/write to the Primary DB first. If an exception (simulated attack) is caught, it automatically reroutes the operation to the Backup DB, a process often referred to as **Automatic Healing**.
* **Data Integrity:** The application attempts to keep both the Primary and Backup databases synchronized (writing to both when the Primary is healthy) to minimize data loss upon a failover event.

### üíª Technology Stack

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend/GUI** | Java Swing (AWT/Swing for desktop application) |
| **Backend/Logic** | Pure Java (JDK 8+) |
| **Database** | MySQL (Simulating two distinct database instances) |
| **Theming** | FlatLaf (for modern look and feel) |
| **Connectivity** | JDBC (MySQL Connector/J) |

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started (Prerequisites)

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)**
2.  **MySQL Server:** A running instance of MySQL.
3.  **MySQL Connector/J:** The JDBC driver for Java, which must be included in your project's classpath.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Database Configuration

Two databases must be created on your local MySQL server:

1.  `user_db` (Primary)
2.  `user_backup_db` (Backup)

The following SQL script should be executed on **both** databases:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Update the database password in Model/DBHandler.java:

Java

// DBHandler.java
private final String DB_PASS = "YOUR_DB_PASSWORD"; // Change this to your actual MySQL password
üöÄ How to Test the Resilience
Run the HomeScreen.java file.

Test 1 (Normal State): Click 'Check Connection' (Primary) and use 'SIGNUP'. Both operations should confirm connection to the Primary DB.

Simulate Attack: Click the 'Open Hacker Window' button, and then click 'Attack to Company Database'. This sets DBHandler.isPrimaryFailing = true;.

Test 2 (Healed State):

Click 'Check Connection' (Primary). It will show ‚ùå ERROR! Database is DOWN.

Attempt a 'SIGNUP' (Write operation). The system will automatically fall back, and the console will show ‚úÖ HEALED! User registered successfully via Backup DB.

Attempt 'Get User' (Read operation). The console will show ‚úÖ HEALED! Data read successfully from Backup DB.
